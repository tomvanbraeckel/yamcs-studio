Event Log
=========

The Event Log view displays events from Yamcs Server. This could be on-board events, or events generated by Yamcs itself, whenever something significant occurs.

To load events for an earlier time range, select |import_wiz| **Import**.

Clear your view by clicking |clear| **Clear**. You can always re-import events again at a later moment.

When Yamcs Studio becomes aware of a new event, it will automatically select and reveal it. You can prevent this default behaviour by toggling the |lock_co| **Scroll Lock**.
